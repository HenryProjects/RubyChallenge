**Homework**  
Get as far through these 2 pieces of setup as you can this afternoon.  

1. [Software Setup](https://source.datanerd.us/engineering-training/newb-relic/blob/master/exercises/main-project/setup_software.md)   
2. [Heroku Setup](https://source.datanerd.us/engineering-training/newb-relic/blob/master/exercises/main-project/setup_heroku.md) 

These are the first step in the Main Project exercise that we will do tomorrow:

If it's too much for you though, or you get stuck, that's ok, we will make sure everybody is synced up before starting the main project work tomorrow and Thursday.  Matt and Ruby are in the Engineering Training HipChat room, or you can HipChat us directly.

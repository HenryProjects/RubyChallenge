# CEO for the Day

## Overview

Use the ourpeople pages combined with Insights queries to answer some of the following questions...and guess at the data points we don't have


## Exercise Objectives

* Synthesize information from our systems to analyze complex business decisions.


## Setup

Will need access to staging to monitor our own systems from Insights.


## Instructions

The focus should be at thinking of the big picture, trying to figure out where the data comes from, and then learn how we can combine that information.


## Questions

1. Which products have grown the most over the past 6 months?
1. Where should we put our next 3 datacenters?
1. If you had $10M more to put into Engineering, where would you put it?

For each of these questions we need to know: 

* What information do I need to better answer these questions?
* Which pieces of information can I find in Insights?


#Conclusion

Why should we care about the bigger picture? 

Did any of this information change your perspective on how we operate?

# Choosing a text-editor

Text-editors are very personal. Talk to people on your team to see what they use. Or just use what you're used to and migrate if you notice that you need a change.

[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is a good option and is confirmed to work for this exercise.

Email askIT@newrelic.com to get a license for the one you want and love (or that your coworkers love).
